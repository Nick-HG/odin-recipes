    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe is to make florentine pizza, an italian dish which is famous for having an egg at the center of the pizza and is a vegetarian based dish.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>400g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 x 240g bag baby spinach</li>
        <li>125g (4oz) mozzarella ball</li>
        <li>250g bag grated mozzarella</li>
        <li>1 x 88g pack Parma ham</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the pizza dough, mix the flour, sugar, 2 tsp salt, and yeast in a bowl. Stir in the oil and add about 300ml lukewarm water to make a soft, but not sticky dough</li>
        <li>Tip onto a floured work surface and knead for 10 mins. Transfer to a clean bowl, cover with oiled clingfilm and set aside to prove in a warm place for 1 hr, or until doubled in size</li>
        <li>cook the tomatoes in a pan until thickened and reduced; season well. Preheat the oven to its highest setting. Divide the dough into 4 and shape each into a ball. Roll out thinly and put on 4 baking sheets lined with nonstick baking paper</li>
        <li>Spread each base with tomato sauce, then scatter over the spinach, mozzarella and ham. Bake, in batches if needed, for 8 mins</li>
        <li>Crack an egg in the centre of each pizza. Continue baking for 2-3 mins more, until the egg is just set and the crust is crisp</li>
    </ol>
