    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe is to make coconut ice cream set in a coconut shell, a typical desert I had on holiday with family in Spain</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Coconut</li>
        <li>400ml can coconut milk</li>
        <li>150ml double cream</li>
        <li>160h can coconut cream</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>Caster sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Split the coconut shell in half, drain the water and remove coconut inside</li>
        <li>Put the coconut milk, double cream and coconut cream in a saucepan and bring almost to the boil</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, whisk the sugar and the egg yolks in a bowl until thick. Pour the coconut milk mixture in a slow stream over the egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly.</li>
        <li>Rinse out the saucepan and return to a low heat. Pour in the custard mixture and stir in the desiccated coconut. Continue to stir constantly for 5-10 mins until the custard thickens slightly and you can trace a line through it with a wooden spoon. Pour into a bowl, then cover the surface of the custard with cling film, allow to cool, then chill for 30 mins.</li>
        <li>Transfer the chilled custard to an ice cream maker and freeze</li>
    </ol>
